	<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I am a Lecturer in the Department of  Computer Science and Engineering, College of Information and Communication Technologies (CoICT),
	University of Dar es Salaam. Software Engineering and Information Systems are my main areas of research, teaching and consultancy.
	Specifically, my Software Engineering research covers the following areas: software smells, clone detection, mining software repositories,
	empirical software engineering,  automated software testing (acceptance test-driven approaches), and static and dynamic program analysis.
	As well, I am keen about research on  the design, development,  implementation,evaluation,  
	and interoperability of Information Systems, particularly in the context of developing countries.
	I am always happy to be contacted for a chat by students or researchers working or wanting to work around these areas.

	<p>I have a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Manchester, UK (2020) where I was supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~embury/">Suzanne M. Embury</a> and <a href="http://nkons.github.io">Nikos Konstantinou</a>. Also, I have an MSc in Computer Science from Osmania University, Hyderabad, India (2012),
		and a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Dar es Salaam (2009). </p>

	<p>From January 2016 to June 2019, I worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in the School of Computer Science, University of Manchester,
		teaching Software Engineering courses. I have also been working as an academic in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering,
		College of Information and Communication Technologies, University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM), where I joined as a tutor in 2009 and subsequently became an Assistant
		Lecturer in 2012, and a Lecturer in 2020. My teaching at UDSM has also has been mainly in Software Engineering and Programming.
